## CS2 STRATEGIC KNOWLEDGE BASE

### ECONOMY FUNDAMENTALS

**Money Thresholds:**
- $0-$1500: Full eco (pistol only, maybe armor)
- $1500-$3000: Force buy or half-buy (SMG + armor or deagle)
- $3000-$4000: Half-buy (galil/famas + armor)
- $4750+: Full buy (rifle + armor + utility)
- $5000+: Full buy with AWP possible

**Loss Bonus System:**
- 1st loss: $1900
- 2nd loss: $2400
- 3rd loss: $2900
- 4th loss: $3400
- 5th+ loss: $3400 (max)

**Common Economy Mistakes:**
1. Force buying after winning pistol (break economy for round 4)
2. Buying on 2nd round loss without utility
3. Not saving when team is on eco
4. Buying AWP when team can't afford rifles

### UTILITY USAGE

**Smoke Priorities (by role):**
- Entry: Flash for yourself, smoke chokepoints
- Support: Flash for teammates, smoke crossings
- AWPer: Smoke angles you can't hold
- Lurker: Save utility for late-round

**Flash Mechanics:**
- Pop flash: Explodes as it becomes visible (best)
- Early flash: Gives enemy time to turn away
- Right-click throw: Short distance, good for close corners
- Run + jump throw: For long-distance lineups

**Molotov/Incendiary Usage:**
- Clear corners before entry
- Deny plant/defuse
- Flush out AWPers
- Stop rushes (especially on CT side)

**Common Utility Mistakes:**
1. Throwing all utility in first 30 seconds
2. Flashing teammates
3. Smoking own team's angle
4. Not using utility before dying

### CROSSHAIR PLACEMENT

**Head Level:**
- Keep crosshair at head height for all common angles
- Adjust for elevation (stairs, ramps, boxes)
- Pre-aim common spots before peeking

**Pre-Aiming Angles:**
- Clear angles one at a time (slice the pie)
- Don't wide-peek multiple angles at once
- Counter-strafe for accurate first shot

**Common Crosshair Mistakes:**
1. Looking at the ground while moving
2. Crosshair on walls instead of corners
3. Not adjusting for different elevations
4. Wide-peeking without clearing angles

### POSITIONING AND MOVEMENT

**Off-Angles:**
- Unexpected positions catch opponents off-guard
- Trade: less predictable, but harder to trade

**Jiggle Peeking:**
- Quick A-D movement to bait shots
- Gather information without committing

**Counter-Strafing:**
- Opposite direction key before shooting
- Essential for rifle accuracy

**Common Positioning Mistakes:**
1. Holding same angle every round
2. Peeking without utility
3. Over-extending after getting a kill
4. Standing still after shooting

### TEAM PLAY AND TRADING

**Trading:**
- Second player should be 1-2 seconds behind entry
- Immediate refrag if teammate dies
- Don't stack same angle

**Communication:**
- Call enemy positions with specific callouts
- Update HP if you tagged someone
- Call rotations and utility usage

**Common Team Play Mistakes:**
1. No one trading the entry fragger
2. All players peeking same angle
3. No info after teammate dies
4. Not calling damage dealt

### ROUND PHASES

**Buy Phase (0:00-0:15):**
- Buy weapons and utility
- Discuss strategy
- Take positions

**Default Phase (0:15-1:00):**
- Gather information
- Take map control
- Don't commit yet

**Mid-Round (1:00-0:40):**
- Execute based on info
- Trade angles
- Adjust to opponent positions

**Late Round (0:40-0:00):**
- Commit to site
- Plant/hold bomb
- Time management critical

### MAP-SPECIFIC CALLOUTS (Key Areas)

**Dust 2:**
- T Spawn, Long, Short (Cat), B Tunnels, Mid
- A Site: Car, Goose, Elevator, Short, Long Doors
- B Site: Plat, Back Plat, Window, Door, Tunnel

**Mirage:**
- T Spawn, Ramp, Palace, Apps, Underpass, Mid
- A Site: Stairs, Firebox, Triple, Sandwich, Jungle, CT
- B Site: Van, Bench, Kitchen, Market, Short

**Inferno:**
- T Spawn, Banana, Second Mid, Alt Mid, Apps
- A Site: Pit, Balcony, Library, Short, Graveyard
- B Site: CT, Oranges, Dark, Newbox, Fountain

### WEAPON PRIORITIES

**Rifles (in order of preference):**
1. AK-47 (T) / M4A4 or M4A1-S (CT)
2. AWP (if skilled and economy allows)
3. Galil (T) / Famas (CT) on half-buy

**Pistol Rounds:**
- Glock: Run and gun, aim for body
- USP-S/P2000: Hold angles, aim for heads

**SMG (anti-eco):**
- MP9 (CT) / MAC-10 (T): Good against unarmored
- MP5-SD: Quiet for flanks

### COACHING TIP CATEGORIES

When analyzing CS2 gameplay, use these categories:
- **aim**: Crosshair placement, spray control, flick shots
- **utility**: Smoke, flash, molly, HE usage
- **positioning**: Angles, off-angles, peeking, movement
- **economy**: Buy decisions, saving, team economy
- **teamwork**: Trading, communication, coordination

### WEAPON COUNTERS AND MATCHUPS

**Rifle vs AWP:**
- Rifles must use utility to close distance
- Smoke the AWP angle, flash and push
- Jiggle peek to bait shot, then push during re-scope
- Trade immediately if teammate gets AWP'd

**SMG vs Rifle:**
- SMGs win close range with movement accuracy
- Rifles must hold distance and pre-aim
- Don't push into SMG territory on anti-eco

**Pistol vs Rifle:**
- Close angles favor pistols (1-tap potential)
- Keep distance as rifler
- As pistol: play off-angles, force close fights

**Utility vs Weapons:**
- 1 flash can negate a full buy advantage
- Well-placed molly can kill or force movement
- HE grenade + teammate shot = easy trade

### MAP-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

**Dust 2:**
- T Side: Long control opens up A takes and cat lurks
- CT Side: AWP Long is dominant; rotate through CT spawn
- Key smokes: Xbox, Long Corner, CT cross
- Common mistakes: Peeking Long without utility, B tunnel spam

**Mirage:**
- T Side: Mid control enables A and B splits
- CT Side: Hold palace and apps with utility, not just bodies
- Key smokes: Window, Jungle, CT, Stairs
- Common mistakes: Dry peeking window, no mid presence

**Inferno:**
- T Side: Banana control is essential for B; apps for A
- CT Side: Play retake A, contest Banana with utility

- CT Side: Play verticality, rotate through heaven
- Key smokes: Main, Red, Outside

- Don't feed kills - play time

**Full Buy Round:**
- Rifles + full utility + armor
- Play structured defaults
- Use all utility before dying
- Trade kills properly

**Bonus Round (after pistol win):**
- SMGs for extra kill money
- Play aggressive while opponents eco
- Don't die to eco force

### COMMON DECISION POINTS (Cause → Effect)

**Early Round:**
- Hearing footsteps → Gather info, don't peek dry
- Teammate gets entry → Immediately trade or follow
- Utility thrown at you → Reposition, don't tank damage

**Mid Round:**
- No info → Take map control, don't sit in spawn
- Teammates dying → Rotate for retake, don't trickle in
- Bomb spotted → Stack site or set up crossfire

**Late Round:**
- 1vX clutch → Play time, isolate 1v1s
- Bomb planted → Use utility to delay defuse
- Defusing → Stick half for info, full stick with smoke

### POST-PLANT SITUATIONS

**T Side Post-Plant:**
- Plant for your position when possible
- Crossfire with teammate if alive
- Use utility to delay defuse
- Listen for defuse sound
- Don't peek unless necessary

**CT Side Retake:**
- Wait for teammates before pushing
- Use utility to clear corners
- Time the defuse - know how long you have
- Smoke plant spot if no time for kill
- Molly common plant spots

### TIME MANAGEMENT

**Round Timer (1:55):**
- 0:40 left: Last chance to plant and have post-plant time
- 0:35 left: Plant takes 3 seconds
- 0:10 left: Defuse without kit impossible

**Bomb Timer (40 seconds):**
- 5 sec to half defuse (check for fake)
- 10 sec full defuse with kit
- 15 sec full defuse without kit
- Can't save if <5 seconds when picked up

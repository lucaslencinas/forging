## CS2 STRATEGIC KNOWLEDGE BASE

### ECONOMY FUNDAMENTALS

**Money Thresholds:**
- $0-$1500: Full eco (pistol only, maybe armor)
- $1500-$3000: Force buy or half-buy (SMG + armor or deagle)
- $3000-$4000: Half-buy (galil/famas + armor)
- $4750+: Full buy (rifle + armor + utility)
- $5000+: Full buy with AWP possible

**Loss Bonus System:**
- 1st loss: $1900
- 2nd loss: $2400
- 3rd loss: $2900
- 4th loss: $3400
- 5th+ loss: $3400 (max)

**Common Economy Mistakes:**
1. Force buying after winning pistol (break economy for round 4)
2. Buying on 2nd round loss without utility
3. Not saving when team is on eco
4. Buying AWP when team can't afford rifles

### UTILITY USAGE

**Smoke Priorities (by role):**
- Entry: Flash for yourself, smoke chokepoints
- Support: Flash for teammates, smoke crossings
- AWPer: Smoke angles you can't hold
- Lurker: Save utility for late-round

**Flash Mechanics:**
- Pop flash: Explodes as it becomes visible (best)
- Early flash: Gives enemy time to turn away
- Right-click throw: Short distance, good for close corners
- Run + jump throw: For long-distance lineups

**Molotov/Incendiary Usage:**
- Clear corners before entry
- Deny plant/defuse
- Flush out AWPers
- Stop rushes (especially on CT side)

**Common Utility Mistakes:**
1. Throwing all utility in first 30 seconds
2. Flashing teammates
3. Smoking own team's angle
4. Not using utility before dying

### CROSSHAIR PLACEMENT

**Head Level:**
- Keep crosshair at head height for all common angles
- Adjust for elevation (stairs, ramps, boxes)
- Pre-aim common spots before peeking

**Pre-Aiming Angles:**
- Clear angles one at a time (slice the pie)
- Don't wide-peek multiple angles at once
- Counter-strafe for accurate first shot

**Common Crosshair Mistakes:**
1. Looking at the ground while moving
2. Crosshair on walls instead of corners
3. Not adjusting for different elevations
4. Wide-peeking without clearing angles

### POSITIONING AND MOVEMENT

**Off-Angles:**
- Unexpected positions catch opponents off-guard
- Trade: less predictable, but harder to trade

**Jiggle Peeking:**
- Quick A-D movement to bait shots
- Gather information without committing

**Counter-Strafing:**
- Opposite direction key before shooting
- Essential for rifle accuracy

**Common Positioning Mistakes:**
1. Holding same angle every round
2. Peeking without utility
3. Over-extending after getting a kill
4. Standing still after shooting

### TEAM PLAY AND TRADING

**Trading:**
- Second player should be 1-2 seconds behind entry
- Immediate refrag if teammate dies
- Don't stack same angle

**Communication:**
- Call enemy positions with specific callouts
- Update HP if you tagged someone
- Call rotations and utility usage

**Common Team Play Mistakes:**
1. No one trading the entry fragger
2. All players peeking same angle
3. No info after teammate dies
4. Not calling damage dealt

### ROUND PHASES

**Buy Phase (0:00-0:15):**
- Buy weapons and utility
- Discuss strategy
- Take positions

**Default Phase (0:15-1:00):**
- Gather information
- Take map control
- Don't commit yet

**Mid-Round (1:00-0:40):**
- Execute based on info
- Trade angles
- Adjust to opponent positions

**Late Round (0:40-0:00):**
- Commit to site
- Plant/hold bomb
- Time management critical

### MAP-SPECIFIC CALLOUTS (Key Areas)

**Dust 2:**
- T Spawn, Long, Short (Cat), B Tunnels, Mid
- A Site: Car, Goose, Elevator, Short, Long Doors
- B Site: Plat, Back Plat, Window, Door, Tunnel

**Mirage:**
- T Spawn, Ramp, Palace, Apps, Underpass, Mid
- A Site: Stairs, Firebox, Triple, Sandwich, Jungle, CT
- B Site: Van, Bench, Kitchen, Market, Short

**Inferno:**
- T Spawn, Banana, Second Mid, Alt Mid, Apps
- A Site: Pit, Balcony, Library, Short, Graveyard
- B Site: CT, Oranges, Dark, Newbox, Fountain

### WEAPON PRIORITIES

**Rifles (in order of preference):**
1. AK-47 (T) / M4A4 or M4A1-S (CT)
2. AWP (if skilled and economy allows)
3. Galil (T) / Famas (CT) on half-buy

**Pistol Rounds:**
- Glock: Run and gun, aim for body
- USP-S/P2000: Hold angles, aim for heads

**SMG (anti-eco):**
- MP9 (CT) / MAC-10 (T): Good against unarmored
- MP5-SD: Quiet for flanks

### COACHING TIP CATEGORIES

When analyzing CS2 gameplay, use these categories:
- **aim**: Crosshair placement, spray control, flick shots
- **utility**: Smoke, flash, molly, HE usage
- **positioning**: Angles, off-angles, peeking, movement
- **economy**: Buy decisions, saving, team economy
- **teamwork**: Trading, communication, coordination

# Game Content Usage Guidelines

## Project Context
This document outlines the legal considerations and usage guidelines for incorporating game assets from Age of Empires II and Counter-Strike into our AI coach hackathon project.

## What We CAN Use

### Your Own Gameplay Screenshots ✅
Screenshots captured from our own gameplay sessions are generally acceptable under fair use, particularly when used for educational, commentary, or transformative purposes like building an AI coach.

**Why this works:**
- Screenshots depict a small part of the overall work and don't substitute for the original game
- Screenshots used for educational purposes are transformative and generally qualify as fair use
- Hackathon projects are educational/research-oriented, strengthening the fair use argument

### Age of Empires II - Microsoft's Game Content Usage Rules ✅

Microsoft has specific Game Content Usage Rules that allow use of gameplay footage, screenshots, and other game elements for personal, noncommercial projects.

**Allowed:**
- Your own gameplay screenshots
- Creating derivative works for personal, noncommercial use
- Using game titles for discovery and referential purposes (e.g., "Tips and Strategies for Age of Empires II")

**Required Attribution:**
```
Age of Empires II © Microsoft Corporation. [Your Project Name] was created 
under Microsoft's "Game Content Usage Rules" using assets from Age of Empires II, 
and it is not endorsed by or affiliated with Microsoft.
```

## What We CANNOT Use

### Ripped Game Assets ❌
Cannot extract or rip assets directly from game files - everything must be captured through gameplay or be self-made.

### Official Logos in Certain Contexts ⚠️
Microsoft product icons and logos may not be used in advertising, software applications, online locations, or in ways that suggest Microsoft endorsement.

### Monetization ❌
Cannot sell or earn compensation from items using Microsoft game content, including through advertisements.

## Counter-Strike - Valve Corporation

Valve's policies are less clear and more restrictive than Microsoft's.

**Key Concerns:**
- Valve has shut down fan projects for Counter-Strike with cease-and-desist orders
- Valve allows mod content for non-commercial purposes between Valve games, but commercial use requires prior contact
- Valve doesn't have explicit "fan content usage rules" like Microsoft

**Recommendations for Counter-Strike:**
- Use only your own gameplay screenshots
- Avoid using the CS logo prominently
- Don't use "Counter-Strike" in project title in ways suggesting official endorsement
- Consider generic terminology like "tactical shooter AI coach"

## Practical Implementation Guidelines

### Safest Approach
1. Use only your own gameplay screenshots captured during play
2. Add clear attribution to both Microsoft and Valve
3. Make it obviously fan/educational content with disclaimers
4. Keep it non-commercial (perfect for hackathon)
5. Don't use official logos prominently - stick to gameplay screenshots
6. Be transformative - the AI coach adds significant value beyond displaying game images

### For Cover Art/Marketing Images
- **Safer option:** Create your own stylized artwork inspired by the games
- **Riskier option:** Use small, low-resolution official images with proper attribution and only for identification purposes

## Important Legal Disclaimers

**This is not legal advice.** The information in this document is for educational purposes based on publicly available policies and general fair use principles.

The legal landscape around game content use is complex and situation-dependent. For a hackathon project that is:
- Educational
- Non-commercial
- Uses your own screenshots
- Properly attributed

You are generally in safer territory under fair use principles.

**However:** If this project evolves into something commercial or gains significant public attention, consult with an attorney about your specific use case.

## The Golden Rule

**Your own gameplay screenshots + educational purpose + proper attribution + non-commercial = generally safe for hackathon**

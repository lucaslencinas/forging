## Script

### 0:00-0:25 - Hook & Problem (25 sec)

**[Show: Split screen - AoE2 gameplay on left, CS2 gameplay on right]**

> "Whether you're playing Age of Empires or Counter-Strike, the frustration is the same - you lost, and you're not sure why. Human coaches cost $50 to $150 an hour. Pro VOD reviews are generic. Self-review takes forever."

**[Show: Esports tournament footage or prize pool graphic]**

> "Esports is a $2 billion industry. Tournament prizes have never been higher. Coaching has become professionalized. But personalized improvement is still out of reach for most players."

**[Transition to: Forging landing page]**

> "This is Forging - an AI gaming coach built with Gemini 3. Let me show you how it works across two completely different games."

---

### 0:25-1:00 - Demo Part 1: Age of Empires II (35 sec)

**[Show: Game selection - choose AoE2]**

> "First, Age of Empires II - a real-time strategy game where you manage an economy while building armies."

**[Action: Upload AoE2 video]**

> "I upload a recording of a ranked match."

**[Show: Loading/analysis state briefly, then cut to results]**

> "Gemini 3 watches the entire 25-minute game - understanding resource bars, unit compositions, build timings."

**[Show: AoE2 results]**

> "Here's my coaching report. The AI caught that I floated 1,800 resources at the 14-minute mark while under pressure - a classic intermediate mistake. It identified my late scout timing and ranked my improvement priorities."

---

### 1:00-1:35 - Demo Part 2: Counter-Strike 2 (35 sec)

**[Show: Game selection - choose CS2]**

> "Now let's try something completely different - Counter-Strike 2, a tactical first-person shooter."

**[Action: Upload CS2 video]**

> "Same platform, different game."

**[Show: CS2 results]**

> "The analysis shifts to what matters in an FPS - crosshair placement, positioning, utility usage. Here it flagged that I was pre-aiming at body level instead of head height, and my smoke timing on B site was late."

**[Highlight the contrast]**

> "Same Gemini 3 model, same platform architecture - but it understands completely different visual languages. That's the power of multimodal AI."

---

### 1:35-2:10 - Technical Deep Dive (35 sec)

**[Show: Architecture diagram]**

> "How does this work? Three key Gemini 3 features."

**[Highlight: Multimodal]**

> "First, multimodal video understanding. Gemini watches gameplay frames and understands what's happening - no game API needed. It reads RTS resource bars the same way it reads FPS crosshairs."

**[Highlight: Long context]**

> "Second, long context. Whether it's a 5-minute CS2 round or a 40-minute AoE2 match, Gemini processes the entire game."

**[Highlight: Structured output]**

> "Third, structured output. Consistent JSON means I can build a real application with timestamps, categories, and priorities - not just a chatbot."

**[Show: Code/backend briefly]**

> "Backend is Python and FastAPI. Adding a new game is a prompt change, not an infrastructure rebuild."

---

### 2:10-2:50 - Market & Vision (40 sec)

**[Show: Esports stats graphic]**

> "Esports is massive and growing. $2 billion market. $40 million tournament prize pools. 500 million viewers. Coaching has become a real profession - but it's still expensive and inaccessible."

**[Show: App with both game options]**

> "Forging democratizes coaching. The same platform that analyzed my Age of Empires economy can analyze my Counter-Strike aim. Today it's two games. The architecture supports any game where watching gameplay reveals insights."

**[Show: Vision mockup or concept graphic - skill radar chart, learning path]**

> "The vision goes further. Skill radar charts showing your strengths and weaknesses. Graded metrics from C+ to S+. Personalized learning paths that guide you from Gold to Platinum. Not just analysis - a complete coaching platform."

**[List of future games]**

> "Valorant. League of Legends. Dota 2. The framework is ready."

---

### 2:50-3:00 - Closing (10 sec)

**[Show: App landing page with URL]**

> "Forging - AI coaching for the games you love. Built with Gemini 3."

> "Try it now at [URL]."

**[End card with GitHub link]**

## Recording Tips

1. **Practice the script 2-3 times** before recording
2. **Have both game results pre-loaded** - don't wait for real analysis during recording
3. **Speak slightly slower** than feels natural - nerves speed you up
4. **Pause at transitions** - easier to edit
5. **Keep energy up** especially when switching between games
6. **Show, don't just tell** - every claim should have a visual

## Timing Checkpoints

| Timestamp | You should be at... |
|-----------|---------------------|
| 0:25 | Starting AoE2 demo |
| 1:00 | Starting CS2 demo |
| 1:35 | Starting technical section |
| 2:10 | Starting market/vision |
| 2:50 | Wrapping up |

If you're behind, cut the vision mockup section. If ahead, expand on the skill radar/learning path vision.

## Key Moments to Emphasize

1. **The switch between games** - This is your "wow factor" moment. Same platform, totally different games.
2. **The esports market stats** - Judges care about impact. $2B market, $40M prizes, 500M viewers.
3. **"Adding a new game is a prompt change"** - Shows extensibility and technical sophistication.
4. **The vision slide** - Skill radars, graded metrics, learning paths. Shows you're thinking beyond MVP.

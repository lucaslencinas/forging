# Future AI Features

Ideas for AI-powered features to add to Forging.

## Analysis Enhancements

### AI Chat with Your Replay
- Ask questions about your game: "Why did I lose that fight?" "What should I have done at 5:00?"
- Uses the replay data + video context to answer
- Gemini can reference specific timestamps

### Skill Progression Tracking
- Analyze multiple games over time
- AI identifies patterns: "Your early eco improved, but late-game army composition is inconsistent"
- Generates personalized practice drills

### Build Order Detection & Comparison
- AI detects what build order you attempted
- Compares to pro/meta builds: "You went 21 pop scouts but delayed your second TC by 2 minutes vs optimal"

### Opponent Analysis
- "Your opponent went Franks knights - here's what you should have done differently"
- Counter-strategy suggestions based on what the AI sees in the video

## Voice & Audio

### Live Commentary Mode
- Generate a full esports-style commentary of your game
- "And here we see Player 1 pushing with knights while their economy falls behind..."

### Custom Coach Personas
- Choose coaching style: Encouraging, Drill Sergeant, Pro Player, etc.
- Different prompts for TTS tone

## Visualization

### AI-Generated Highlight Reel
- Auto-clip the most important moments (big fights, eco peaks, key mistakes)
- Generate a 1-2 minute summary video

### Heatmaps from Video
- AI describes where your units/attention was focused
- "You rarely looked at your eco after 15 minutes"

## Game-Specific (CS2)

### Aim Analysis
- Frame-by-frame crosshair placement analysis
- "Your crosshair was too low entering site"

### Utility Grading
- Rate your smokes/flashes vs. common lineups
- Suggest better utility usage

## Game-Specific (AoE2)

- "You had 15 seconds of idle TC at 8:30"

## Interactive

### Practice Drill Generator
